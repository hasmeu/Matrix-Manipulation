# MatrixLib

A lightweight C library for dense matrix and vector operations, designed for simplicity, security, and efficiency.

## Features
- Supports dense matrices and vectors (as special-case matrices).
- Simple, secure access to matrix elements with optional bounds checking.
- Automatic management of matrix dimensions.
- Supports multiple data types per matrix (e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`).
- Configurable row-major or column-major storage (library-wide).
- Robust error checking and recovery.
- Operations:
  - Initialize matrices.
  - Get/set elements, rows, or columns.
  - Extract or set matrix subsets.
  - Resize matrices.
  - Add, subtract, or multiply matrices.
  - Create deep copies.
  - Check matrix equivalence (instance or element-wise).
  - Rotate matrices in-place.
- Unit tests included
